> "Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today"

-Malcom X

Education provides us with an appreciation of the world around us and turns it into a better world. Through Education, a perspective of looking at life grows in us. It allows us to develop opinions on topics in life and to have different viewpoints. People are debating whether education is the only thing that provides knowledge. Many claim the process of acquiring information about the surrounding environment is education and Knowledge is something very different from that. They are correct in their viewpoint but without education, information cannot be translated into knowledge. A good Education helps in building a strong foundation, upon which a person can develop his own life, in his own way.

The education system in India is struggling from and has not seen any reform, which is much required need of the hour. India is no where among the best education systems in the world because of its rote system that focuses on theories more than practical. This methodology of teaching kills the creativity in a student and also makes the process of learning a lot harder. There are only a few opportunities for professional degree courses in India, with medical, engineering and CA at top of the list. You're going to be demeaned if you're not one of them. Whereas a doctor gets the same respect overseas as a singer does. There is also a respectable career choice for music, art and sports. Hence there is a need of transformation in the system design.

Education also plays a very important role in career building, as with right education and skill one can excel in the career of his/her own choice. Without proper education, these choices are highly narrowed down, with a few options remaining that are looked down by the Indian society. For career development and success as well, education is crucial. The person that is well trained can definitely understand the various aspects and factors related to a job better than those that are not, and the educated person will change the processes to produce better outcomes that will lead to success. Hence, we as a group tried to teach the students about the various aspects related to career and education. 

Over the past month, we had the opportunity to conduct four very interesting sessions with the school students. In our previous post, we discussed details about the class, the need and our goals for the intervention. Since then, with each session we took steps towards our overall goal of inculcating a self-driven habit of holistically looking at their future career aspirations and planning on how to achieve them in the students. In this concluding post, we would like to showcase what we experienced, some challenges we faced and what we took from this.

We adopted an activity-based pedagogy for teaching concepts to the students. We had the core session objective at the centre, around which an activity was developed. Each activity was embellished with gamification elements to make the learnings more enjoyable and concrete. Gamification 's increasing success stems from the assumption that it can promote inspiration, behavioural improvements, friendly rivalry and collaboration and we observed the similar, in our sessions also. 

After our intervention, we used to have a small discussion with the children on what they were learning from the courses. Some of these learnings were eye-opening for us as well, as it led us to think about our own education. We understood that correcting such changes would actually need effort from the administration level as well.

## Key Findings from the Intervention

1. **Lack of focus on career in curriculum:** Students (at the impressionable age of 14-15) chose careers ranging from a pilot to an archaeologist, covering anything and everything in between. But students were not clear how to reach such a goal, evident when we asked them to chose subjects that might help them in their careers. For example, when we asked a student to choose subjects for achieving their goal of being an archaeologist, the student got extremely puzzled. Such an experience tells that the curriculum taught in school and the subsequent job market is decoupled. In a country where, prevalence for pursuing job is more after studies than research work, such a decoupling will only create despair for our bright-eyed Gen Z teenagers when they reach work age.  

2. **Theoretical Underpinnings behind gamification:** We saw that certain theories of motivation worked in practice with the students enabling us towards making the students involved in their work. Some of them were:
    **Variable Extinction (Ratio and Interval):** The game where the students chose a certain profession and played a game based on their choices in session 2 helped us understand what makes the students excited. In 7th round, some students were randomly fired while others kept on playing in that round. Such a variable extinction which was not foretold to the student helped us in getting their attention and understand the subtleties of life.
    **Expectancy Value Theory:** In our first session, we asked the students about their profession and asked them why. So, most of them gave a very articulate answer ranging from “I have heard my Dad say good things about this” to “I want to do something good for the society”. But, when we started asking them about their role models, most of them identified to the movie stars who portrayed the profession rather than the actual people. This showed the bias created by movies in our society and how it affects a student’s choices. 

3. **Points, Badges and Leaderboards:** A game like PUBG and Clash of Clans is extremely famous for giving points, badges and leader boards which has a high perceived value in the gamer community. This was started by Counter Strike with their skins mod. A gamer who plays and wins in a game which is just at the tip of the zone of the proximal development can win such prizes. This makes the gamer play more as they feel a sense of achievement. This is similar for the students as well. When we announced the winner of each week, they felt good about their accomplishments and it resulted in 90% attendance from the students even on a Sunday. Statements like “I can do this easily” or “I have the capability of doing this” are all results of self-efficacy and justifying such results by the points, badges and leader-boards helps the student to self-actualize their winnings of the future. 

4. **Activity based Learnings:** If someone asks us to remember a learning that we had recently, the brain will always point towards an experience where we learned something instead of a theoretical abstract thing we learnt in college/school. Application based learnings are imbibed in the brain. If I ask someone to not touch a pan because its hot, it might not work instead if they touch the pan and they feel its hot, then they won’t touch it ever again. Similarly, application-based learnings help the students understand the concepts better as well. We wanted to tell the students about the importance of other factors such as job security, work life balance while choosing certain jobs. They should not get myopic with singular factors such as the wage rate or status symbolism only. After the session 2 game, they came to us individually and started telling us about the other good aspects of their jobs because of which they chose such jobs, which tells us that our game was a success.

5. **Group Activities vs Individual Activities:** Two schools of thoughts are present while formation of any group – Random choice and Choice based on the participants preference. Even though, the initial thought allows reduction in the sampling error for the students, but this would result in some groups containing extremely motivated students and some groups containing extremely demotivated. The second thought would result in certain bias as the students might choose best group partners appropriating their winnings. Instead another thought works which comes from the theoretical underpinnings of Scaffolding which is a subset of self-determination theory, which includes modelling of the students on the basis of each other and encouragement for self-actuating their goals. Formation of groups having some members which are motivated would result in encouragement for the demotivated students as well. The goal of the study is to make everyone motivated, so the demotivated students can look towards the motivated students as role models. This theory worked perfectly as the students who didn’t want to participate in the beginning were doing so after being a part of a group.

## Limitations & Changes We Would Have Made, In Retrospect

Our experiences in the past month designing and implementing the intervention led us to gain first-hand insight of the massive effort that goes into teaching and we found ourselves gaining a deeper respect for teachers in general. Given our inexperience and the numerous aspects of the intervention plan that needed to be designed and implemented, there were some obvious limitations to our approach. The following are the list of limitations and challenges we faced:

1. **Virtual/non-physical nature of the sessions:** Given Covid-19 measures, all sessions were conducted over Zoom. The virtual nature of the sessions brought their own challenges, which we perhaps wouldn’t have faced otherwise. Students as well as our team sometimes had connectivity/bandwidth issues which led to losses in audio quality or broken audio. Additionally, as we have experienced during our online classes, it is inherently difficult to fully focus in online settings, given that we are not really present. Distraction is a constant possibility given the multi-tasking capabilities of digital devices. It also almost becomes impossible to monitor for the instructor whether a student is really engaged. Another big factor that contributes to disengagement is the inability for students to interact amongst themselves in an online class setting. One more issue faced was to immediately get student’s paper-based responses when conducting some of the activities that required it. Doing so required taking a time-consuming route of all students sending the page images and collating them one by one. 

2. **Homework:** For the first two sessions, we saw limited turn-in for the homework given to the students after each. Originally, we had not planned to include scoring for the homework as well, but we changed this afterwards to provide some additional motivation, after which turn-in rates improved substantially. Even though the homework we assigned to students pertained to the career they had chosen themselves during the introductory session, we found the students to have exerted minimal effort given the homework quality which can perhaps be attributed to other school-related commitments

3. **Not losing sight of the end-goal (Over-Gamification):** We noticed that the score-keeping and fun-nature of the activities may often have the unwanted effect of derailing attention from the broader lessons to be taken. The end-goal for our sessions was for the students to inculcate a self-driven habit of gaining a holistic understanding of selected professions and how to get there. Each activity contributed lessons towards understanding this holism. Revising these lessons at the start of each session and homework helped here

In retrospect, after gaining experiential insights over the past month, there are a number of things we would have liked to change. The following are the most prominent ones:

1. **Homework scoring & feedback:** In our original intervention plan, we did not include scoring for homework, which we did only from Session 3 onwards. We noticed turn-in rates to directly increase due to this. Additionally, due to low turn-in rates initially feedback provided for the homework was limited. In retrospect, we would have included scoring & feedback for homework throughout all sessions.

2. **Group-based activities & homework:** We discovered Session 2 to be the most engaging for the students due to the group-oriented nature of the activities. A facilitator (from among our team) for each group, drastically increased participation and engagement as inter-student interaction was possible with small group sizes interacting through Zoom’s break-out room feature. Hence, we would have liked to include more group-based activities and homework. 

3. **Session-wise rewards:**  We would also like to enact session-wise rewards for per session performance of students. This would have the effect of providing a level of immediate motivation instead of the delayed gratification from waiting for the results of the overall leader board.

## Three Major Learnings

1. **Advance Students, Lacking curriculum – Huge potential in students:**
we observed that a lot of students are interested in new technologies and advancements, but these are neither discussed nor included in the education system. The Education system needs to upgrade its content and should form a committee for regular renewal of such content 

2. **Lack of Choice and Flexibility:**
The education system is very rigid and gives no option to the students to pursue subjects they like. For example, students have to compulsory study Sanskrit and other languages which might not be much useful in future. This increase burden upon students. This time can be utilised for other activities like sports, critical thinking capabilities enhancement etc.


3. **Gamification and motivation (potential of e-learning platforms):**
A lot of students, even from lower economic sections have access to basic smartphone and internet. This can be utilised to provide learning in a gamified version for subjects and can be customised according to each student. This will help in instant feedback system also which is missing from traditional system.

## Conclusion
Overall, this whole field project has been an endearing and humbling learning opportunity for us into gaining first-hand experience of imparting education, its inherent challenges & how gamification can be a highly useful technique in the educator’s toolbox for solving them. We would really like to thank all the students who undertook this journey with us (and who we now know by their names). We would also like to thank the class teacher, Mr. Chirag Parekh* and the school principal for their indispensable support and experience as educators which enabled us to smoothly conduct these sessions. We would also like to thank our course instructor and the AAs for our course for this course and their constant feedback & support. Though difficult at times, the course truly makes us appreciate the role of teachers and massive, often underappreciated, complexity of the educational process.
