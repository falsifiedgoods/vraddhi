Interaction Details – 
Date: 13th August, 2020 
Mode: Online, Zoom (all students using the app on their parents' phones)
Attendees: 14/20 male students + Mr. Chirag Parikh* (the class teacher) + our team (five members)

The objective of the interaction was to know the career aspirations of the kids so that we can intervene with a gamified program to enhance their current level of understanding of different professions

Some notable features of the student demographics (Conducted by an advanced survey) - 
1.	Most students belonged from Ahmedabad with Gujarati spoken at home. 
2.	Many students belonged from financially & socially marginalised backgrounds using their parent’s cell phone for connecting to the meeting
3.	Most students' parents had a limited or no exposure to higher-education.
4. The following was the age distribution among students:

This first session was mainly for breaking ice with the students. We also wanted to know their clarity regarding their interests & future aspirations. These interactions were informative where children themselves revealed their preferences regarding subjects, hobbies, career aspirations along with family background.

Some notable things to emerge from the discussion were:

1.	**Clarity about career aspirations:** To our surprise most of the students had clear future aspirations (unlike us at that age). Some of these preferences were engineer, CA, policeman & archaeologist (the last one being a pleasant surprise)

2.	**Academic interests:** Students preferred Mathematics and Science with social science to be a usual dislike.

3.	**Hobbies:** Most students mentioned cricket & gaming to be among their favourites.

The following were some of the strengths & weakness witnessed among the group:

1.	**Basic clarity regarding career:** Most students were clear about what they wanted to pursue as a career and why. 

2.	**Strong academic interests:** Every student had strong favourites among subjects. This is encouraging because career aspirations often stems from hobbies & academic interests in one’s school life.  

3.	**Limited extracurricular pursuits:** The range and depth of the hobbies pursued were often limited, with students being unable to answer basic questions about them.

4.	**Limited help outside school in academic pursuits:** Most of the students mentioned self-studying as the primary manner of after-school study.

5.	**Lack of knowledge about career range & career depth:** Very limited career options were mentioned during the session. Students also had misconceptions with hardly any knowledge of how to reach those career goals.  

The students showed an intrinsic motivation to become respectful in society through a profession they love, but there was also a lack of deeper understanding of the paths to achieve that. 

For example, Samir wanted to be a Civil Engineer because he loved to design buildings on a paper before constructing them. When we said that this passion of his is related to architecture, he spaced out. This shows that the students didn't have much idea about the subtleties of the profession. Such an incident led us to believe that a comprehensive understanding of professions needs to be there, and we can plan an intervention to bridge these gaps.

We want to give the students an extensive understanding of the professional aspirations that they can pursue. We intend to do this using a three-pronged approach which is mentioned below - 

1.	**Breadth of professions:** Different professions that students can pursue and what are the differences between them.

2.	**Depth of a profession:** Intricacies of a profession for example the work aspect, risks and rewards associated, and work-life balance of a profession.

3.	**Path to a profession:** Requirements that might be needed for pursuing a profession.

All these factors will be measured by a questionnaire, filled by individual student at the end of session 1 and session 5
