On Thursday (13th July, 2020), we had the first session with school students for our course, Gamification, Technology & Learning Motivation. We had been assigned a class of grade nine (Gujarati medium), with twenty students, all boys at a government school located in Ahmedabad. The course requires us to design an intervention plan using elements from gamification theory to provide learning to these students in a subject matter of our choosing from a set of relevant topics. Among these, we chose “Education & Career Aspirations”. 

The meeting took place over Zoom at 10:00 in the morning and was attended by our team consisting of five members, fourteen of the class’s twenty students and Mr. Chirag Parekh*, the class teacher. All these students attended using the Zoom app on their parents’ smartphones. Six students from the class were absent from the session or dropped off after sometime due to connection issues. We talked to Mr. Parekh and also floated a pre-session survey through him to understand overall basic demographics of the class. 

1. Most students belonged from Ahmedabad with Gujarati spoken at home. 

2. Mr. Parekh mentioned many students in the class to be from financially & socially marginalised backgrounds.

3. For most students, their parents had a limited or no exposure to higher-education.

4. The following graph shows the age-wise distribution of the students:

This first session was mainly meant for getting introduced to & breaking ice with the students. We also wanted them to know them better in terms of their self-knowledge regarding their interests & future aspirations to design a viable plan for the upcoming sessions. The team first introduced themselves to the students and then we encouraged the students to introduce themselves. This was done for all the fourteen students present. These introductions were very interactive in the sense that we as a team tried to encourage the students to speak freely & worked to know them better through additional questions where appropriate. The following were the broad areas around which the students introduced themselves: from where they belonged, languages known, hobbies pursued, likes & dislikes among academic subjects & career aspirations, if any.    

Some things of note to emerge from the discussion were:

1. **Clarity about career aspirations:** To our surprise most of the students had an inkling of their future aspirations (unlike us at that age). For some, these choices came from a strong interest or ideal and for some, through more grounded means such as having a relative working in a particular profession. As a team, we believe both these means to be equally valid. Two of the more popular choices were “policeman” & “commercial pilot”, as mentioned by multiple students. One student having a strong drive to discover yet unknown facts about India’s rich past mentioned “archaeologist” as a career aspiration.

2. **Academic interests:** Some of the most popular subjects among the students were Mathematics and Science with social science to be a usual dislike. 

3. **Hobbies:** Most students mentioned cricket & gaming to be among their favorites.

<br>
The following were some of the strengths & weakness witnessed among the group:

1. **Basic clarity regarding career:** Most students were clear about what they wanted to pursue as a career and why. This can be seen as a sign of interest in their futures and prior thinking on the same.

2. **Strong academic interests:** Overall each student had strong favorites among subjects. This is encouraging because career aspirations often stem from hobbies & academic interests in one’s school life.

3. **Limited extracurricular pursuits:** The range and depth of the hobbies pursued were often limited, with students being often unable to answer basic questions about them.

4. **Limited academic help outside school:** Most of the students mentioned self-studying as the primary manner of after-school study with little to no help from parents or siblings. 

5. **Lack of knowledge about career range & career depth:** Very limited career options were mentioned during the session. While this can be reflective of the job market itself, we believe a more richer variety should be known to students. Apart from this, students when asked further questions about their career choices were often seen to have misconceptions with hardly any knowledge of how to reach those career goals. 

The students showed an intrinsic motivation to become respectful in society through a profession they love, but there was also a lack of deeper understanding of the paths to achieve that. 

For example, Samir wanted to be a Civil Engineer. He reasoned by saying he loves to design buildings on a paper before constructing them. When we said that this passion of his is related to architecture, he spaced out. This shows that the students didn't have much idea about the subtleties of the profession.

Had Samir been told about the difference between Architecture and Civil Engineering, he might go for a different path to Architecture than civil engineering. Such an incident led us to believe that a comprehensive understanding of professions needs to be there and we can plan an intervention to bridge these gaps.

<br> 
We want to give the students an extensive understanding of the professional aspirations that they can pursue. We intend to do this using a three-pronged approach mentioned below:

1. **Breadth of professions:** For this, we want the student to understand what are the different professions that they can pursue and what is the difference between them.<br>**Metric:** We can have a comparison questionnaire, where the students individually in session 1 will be asked to tell the difference between two professions. Points will be given according to the number of differences. A similar method will be used in the last session and we would see if there is any improvement in the number of points for a particular student.

2. **Depth of a profession:** For this, we want the student to understand the deeper intricacies of a profession for example the work aspect, risks and rewards associated, and work-life balance of a profession.<br>**Metric:** In the above mentioned questionnaire, we will have a game where students need to match professions with their characteristics. We will conduct this game during session 1 and the last session and compare the results. The characteristics can be risks and rewards involved, amount of leisure time etc.

3. **Path to a profession:** For this, we want the student to understand the requirements that might be needed for pursuing a profession.<br>**Metric:** In the above mentioned questionnaire, we will have a “Fill in the blanks” kind of a sequence game, where the student needs to decide on the route taken for ultimately becoming a professional. In this, positive reinforcements will be given in the form of points based on the correct choice. Scores from Session 1 and last session will be compared.
